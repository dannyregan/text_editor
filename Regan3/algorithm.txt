Read the text file and store it as a variable for use thorughout the program
Remove capitalizations and punctuation from the text for use throughout the code
Split the text into a list where each word is its own element
Create a loop displaying the menu options to the usher.
The displayMenu function has a list of all the function titles. It goes through the list and prints a number, starting at 1 and increasing with each title, followed by the title.
Have the user select an option. Their selection corresponds with a relevant function
Call the relevant function. If the function alters the text in the file, return the updated text. Otherwise, just return the relevant information that the function provides
The AllWordCount function looks through the text and makes a new sequence showing each word and how many times it appeared
The single word count asks you what word you want to look up. It then looks through the text for the specific word and counts how many times it appears
The LeastCommonWords function works the same way as AllWordCount, but sorts the list from least to greatest rather than greatest to least number of occurances
The ReplaceWord function asks for a word to be replaced and a new word to swap it out for. Then, it looks through the text for the word to be replaced and changes it to the new one.
The AddText function takes your new text and adds it to the end of the original text
The DeleteText function looks for the first occurance of the word you want to delete. Then, it removes it from the text
The highlight text works the same as the ReplaceWord function, but it changes the old word to its uppercase counterpart and adds some "**" on either side of it.
Once all the changes have been made, the SaveFile function will join all the words together and seperate them by a space before overwriting the original file with the new text. It then quits the program
